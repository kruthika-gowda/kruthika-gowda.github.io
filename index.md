### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 1 stood out as one of my favorite labs.  I've always disliked manual measurement conversions, preferring to use AI instead. However, the opportunity to code and observe the conversion process firsthand was quite intriguing. This lab had a greater level of complexity than prior ones, which was a nice challenge for both my partner and me. In the end, this difficulty provided both of us with valuable learning opportunities.

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, Part 1 is one of my favorite labs.  While we had already completed a sandwich order lab earlier in the semester, this lab added a fun twist by incorporating the game of mad libs, which added an extra layer of complexity to the coding process. This Part 1 was the first time I completed a whole part on my own, and despite the difficulties, it proved to be a good learning experience. Furthermore, this lesson delves into the notion of vectors, which had been quite difficult for me to comprehend conceptually. The hands-on nature of this lab, on the other hand, really added to my understanding of vectors.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 part 2 was another lab I really enjoyed. The scheduling component is quite fascinating in the real world. Making schedules is something I've been doing for a long time, but I never thought to use code to create them. I really enjoyed being able to create something that could be utilized every day. Although it did present its own challenges like determining whether the provided schedules form a valid schedule without conflicts, I ultimately learned a lot from this lab.
